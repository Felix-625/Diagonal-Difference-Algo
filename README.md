# Diagonal-Difference-Algo

The program begins by importing several standard libraries, although not all are used in the code. The Result class contains a static method called diagonalDifference, which accepts a two-dimensional list of integers (List<List<int>> arr) representing a square matrix. Inside the method, two variables primaryDiagonalSum and secondaryDiagonalSum are initialized to zero to store the sums of the matrix's main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and secondary diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left), respectively. A for loop iterates over the matrix rows using an index i, where arr[i][i] accesses the main diagonal elements and arr[i][n - i - 1] accesses the secondary diagonal elements. After computing both sums, the method returns the absolute difference between them using Math.Abs.

In the Solution class, the Main method handles input and output. It first sets up a TextWriter to write the output, then reads an integer n from the console, which represents the number of rows (and columns) in the square matrix. It initializes a 2D list arr and fills it by reading n lines of space-separated integers from the user, converting each line into a list of integers. Once the matrix is constructed, it calls the diagonalDifference method from the Result class and writes the returned result to the output file specified by the environment variable OUTPUT_PATH.
